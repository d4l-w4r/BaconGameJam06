###TODO:

  * implement obstacles as array to have them more scalable
  * fix dirty clock hack cause it messes up jumping
  * implement camera for side scrolling
  * extend walkcycle by 2 frames

###In-progress:

  * implemented alternative method 'movex' instead of 'move_x' in player to handle collision better
  * right now whenever you touch an obstacle you're stuck --> fix so you're stuck only when you try to move further towards the obstacle
